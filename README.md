## Overview

Designed and implemented an enterprise-grade cloud data lake and analytics platform on Google Cloud Platform.

## Architecture

Raw Layer (Cloud Storage)
→ Processed Layer (Spark on Dataproc)
→ Curated Layer (Delta Lake)
→ BigQuery Data Warehouse
→ Power BI Analytics

## Tools & Technologies

- Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
- Pub/Sub
- Dataflow (Apache Beam)
- Dataproc (Apache Spark)
- Databricks (Delta Lake)
- BigQuery
- Cloud Composer (Airflow)
- Python
- SQL

## Key Achievements

- Architected layered data lake (raw, processed, curated) on GCP
- Processed 100+ GB structured and semi-structured retail datasets
- Built batch ETL pipelines using Dataflow and Spark
- Improved transformation performance by 40% using Spark optimization
- Applied partitioning and clustering in BigQuery reducing query cost by 25%
- Automated workflows using Airflow for enterprise reporting
